# Downscaling Near-Surface Air Temperature


## Description
This project aims to downscale near-surface air temperature (Ta) predictions from global climate models to finer spatial resolutions using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a diverse set of features, including satellite data, climate model outputs, and digital elevation models, we develop accurate machine learning models to provide high-resolution Ta data for climate studies.

## Project Structure
**data:** Contains the datasets required for training and validation.

**load_and_process_file:** Scripts for loading and preprocessing data files.

**models:** Implementation of machine learning models for training.

**validation:** Code for validating the models.

**output:** Stores the results and plots generated by the models.

**WeatherDataProcessor:** Modules for processing weather data.

**main_script:** Main script to execute the downscaling process.

## Requirements
Python 3.10

Required Python packages: The required Python packages and their version numbers are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/estipollak/Downscaling-Near-Surface-Air-Temperature.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd yourproject
```
3. Copy data [from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fJq7GHRrrf9pk9E-lTuWwubY_5LrWO2m?usp=sharing) to the data\ERA5 folder.

4. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Execute the main script to start the downscaling process:
```bash
python main.py
```
2. Monitor the progress and check the output folder and console for results.

## Results
Our models achieved impressive accuracy, with RMSE value as follows:

ERA5 hourly Ta: 1.38Â°C
